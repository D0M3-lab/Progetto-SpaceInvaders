## ‚úÖ Requirements

To run the **Space Invaders** game, make sure your system meets the following:

- **Python 3.6+**
- **Tkinter** (standard GUI toolkit included with Python)
- **Pillow** library for image handling (used to load and resize sprites)

### üì¶ Required Packages

Install dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install Pillow
```

Tkinter is usually pre-installed with Python. To verify:

```bash
python -m tkinter
```

If not available, install it manually depending on your system:

- **Ubuntu/Debian**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install python3-tk
  ```

- **Arch Linux**:
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S tk
  ```

- **Windows/Mac**:
  Tkinter is bundled with Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### üñºÔ∏è Image Assets

Make sure the following image files are available in the project directory:

- `player.png`
- `enemy.png`
- `bullet.png`

These files are essential for rendering game sprites.
